# Reading the checklist

The checklist decides what a campaign answers for. This skill reads it and adds nothing.

## Where it comes from

`docs/qa/testing-checklist.md`, in the Hummingbird repository and nowhere else. The skill never
carries a copy: a copy would be wrong the first time the theme changed, which is the one thing
the checklist is built not to be.

**Take it from the release tag matching the theme version.** Two people testing the same release
then read the same checklist, and a campaign resumed months later reads it again unchanged.
`checklist.js` looks for `v<version>` and then `<version>`, and falls back to the working copy
only when neither carries the file. The report says which of the two it used, on its front page,
because a checklist from a moving branch is a weaker basis than one from a tag.

## What counts as a test

Two kinds of line:

* every `- [ ]` tick box
* rows in the tables that list things to test

A table is a list of tests when its **first column heading** says so: `Module`, `Setting`,
`BO tab`. Everything else, product types, profiles, breakpoints, the severity table, the list of
sources the checklist is derived from, is reference material. `checklist.js` prints its decision
for every table it meets, with the heading that decided it, so a wrong call is visible instead of
silently adding or dropping tests.

## Points that change a shop setting

The checklist marks them, and it does so in two ways. Some points carry `(config)` themselves.
Some sections say it once in their own prose, either "everything in this section is (config)" or,
as in the multishipment section, by turning a feature flag on for the whole section. Both are
picked up, and a section that declares it passes it down to its subsections, which is where the
points actually live.

Over-marking a point costs one reading of a setting. Under-marking it leaves the shop altered for
every section that follows, so the reading errs towards marking, and prints the line that decided
it.

## How a point is named

`3.2/07` is the seventh testable line of section 3.2. That name is convenient and, on its own,
a trap: add one line at the top of a section and every number below it shifts, quietly attaching
yesterday's results to the wrong test.

So a point is identified by **its text as well as its position**. `checklist.json` carries a hash
of each point's text, and comparing two revisions matches on that first:

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/checklist.js" --diff old.json new.json
```

It reports additions, removals and moves, naming both the old and the new number for every move.
Read the moves before reusing anything written against the older revision.

## Staying in step with the theme

The theme's own `CONTEXT.md` binds the checklist to the code: change the hook assignments in
`config/theme.yml`, add or remove a module override, add a page or a partial, or change the
breakpoints, and the checklist changes in the same pull request.

So this skill never needs updating when the theme grows a page or a module. What it does need is
for the campaign to read the checklist belonging to the version under test, which is why the tag
matters. If a checklist point turns out to be wrong, that is a correction to propose against the
theme repository, not a finding against the theme: answer that point `inconclusive` with the
reason, list it under `checklistCorrections`, and open no ticket. The full rule is in
[reporting.md](reporting.md).

# PrestaShop Skills

Welcome to the **PrestaShop Skills** repository! This repository serves as a
centralized collection of AI "skills" designed to help you interact with,
manage, and develop for PrestaShop. These skills cover various domains including
PrestaShop modules, core components, and themes.

## ⚠️ Security & Disclaimer

**Use with caution, especially in production environments.**
These skills provide instructions to AI agents that may execute CLI commands (e.g., `bin/console`), modify files, or trigger critical processes like backups and restorations.
- **Always review** the commands and actions proposed by your AI assistant before allowing it to execute them on a live or production store.
- We recommend testing skills on a staging or local environment first.

## ✅ Prerequisites

To use these skills, you will need:
- **Node.js / npm**: Required to run the `npx skills` command.
- **An AI Assistant / Agent**: A compatible AI development tool (such as Cursor, GitHub Copilot CLI, or other agentic frameworks) capable of reading and executing instructions from the installed skills.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

You can easily install the skills you need by using the `npx skills` CLI. The
command will list the available skills in the targeted directory and install
them directly into the compatible AI assistants present on your system.

**General Command syntax:**

```bash
npx skills install PrestaShop/skills/[application]/[user|dev]
```

**Installation Example:** To install operational user skills for the
`autoupgrade` module:

```bash
npx skills install PrestaShop/skills/autoupgrade/user
```

_(For more details on the `npx skills` commands and mechanics, please refer to
the [vercel-labs/skills repository](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills))._

## 📚 Available Skills Inventory

As this repository grows, this list will be updated. Here is a summary of the
skills currently available:

### Domain: `autoupgrade`

| Category | Skill Folder              | Skill Name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `user`   | `prestashop-restore`      | **prestashop-store-rollback** | Restore a PrestaShop store to a previous backup. Use when you need to rollback, for example, if an update fails or if you need to restore a previous state of the store. |
| `user`   | `prestashop-update`       | **prestashop-store-update**   | Update a PrestaShop store by using the Module Update Assistant. Evaluates compatibility and proceeds with the upgrade.                                                   |
| `user`   | `prestashop-update-check` | **prestashop-store-check**    | Check if a PrestaShop store is ready to be updated. Assesses compatibility and available versions without starting the actual update.                                    |

### Domain: `qa`

| Category | Skill Folder       | Skill Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`    | `prestashop-pr-qa` | **prestashop-pr-qa** | QA a pull request against a running environment, in a browser, on the command line or over HTTP: reproduce the bug, verify the fix, and report whether it is approved, with the recording as proof. |

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **application domains**. Currently, the supported
domains include:

- [`autoupgrade`](#domain-autoupgrade) (Module Update Assistant)
- [`qa`](#domain-qa) (Quality assurance on pull requests)

_(More domains like core, specific modules, and themes will be added over
time)._

Inside each application domain, skills are divided into two specific target
audiences:

- 🧑‍💻 **`user`**: Skills intended for store owners, merchants, and agencies.
  These allow you to perform operational actions on your PrestaShop store using
  AI (e.g., updating the store, checking compatibility, or restoring backups).
- 🛠️ **`dev`**: Skills intended for developers. These are tailored to help
  build, debug, and enhance the application domain itself.

**Directory tree example:**

```text

```

## 🤝 How to Contribute

Contributions to add new application domains, user skills, or developer skills are highly encouraged!

To create a new skill:
1. Create a new directory for your skill under the appropriate domain and category (e.g., `[domain]/[user|dev]/[skill-name]`).
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file in that directory.
3. Use the required frontmatter for the skill name and description:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: your-skill-name
   description: A short description of what the skill does.
   ---
   ```
4. Write the detailed, step-by-step instructions for the AI to follow in the rest of the markdown file.
5. Open a Pull Request!
